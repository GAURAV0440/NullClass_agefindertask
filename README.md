# NullClass_agefindertask

AgeFinder Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an Age Prediction Model that uses a pre-trained machine learning model to estimate a person's age based on input features. It includes a trained model, GUI interface and necessary dependencies to run and test the model.

ðŸš€ Features
1. Pre-trained Machine Learning Model for accurate age prediction.
2. GUI Interface for easy input and predictions.
3. Model Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
4. Saved Model & Weights for reuse and testing.
5. Fully Automated Workflow from loading the model to making predictions.

ðŸŽ¯ Model Performance
Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
Optimized for performance and accuracy.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the UTKFace Dataset, which contains images of faces labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity.
You can access and download the dataset from Kaggle:
