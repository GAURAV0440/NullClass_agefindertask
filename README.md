AgeFinder Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an Age Prediction Model that uses a pre-trained machine learning model to estimate a person's age based on input features. It includes a trained model, GUI interface and necessary dependencies to run and test the model.

ðŸš€ Features
1. Pre-trained Machine Learning Model for accurate age prediction.
2. GUI Interface for easy input and predictions.
3. Model Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
4. Saved Model & Weights for reuse and testing.
5. Fully Automated Workflow from loading the model to making predictions.

ðŸŽ¯ Model Performance
Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
Optimized for performance and accuracy.
